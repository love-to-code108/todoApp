# Project description :

-  **Purpose :** <br>
The purpose of this project is basically divided into two parts .
    1. Learning.
    2. A todo app that gets the job done without much complexity and is exactly to the point without any useless clutter or hindrance.


-  **Need for this app :** <br>
Well to be fair i know there are already many pre existing todo apps that are far more capable than just writing simple todos but you see i dont know i somewhere down the line felt that these additonal features are kind of useless to me (**personal opinion**) so i though why not try and make a simple secure and to the point application that does exactly what it is ment to do . Also there was the fact that i wanted to build something and understand different concepts of web development by building them.

- **Target Audience :** <br>
So who are the target audience for this application
**no one!!** i am making this app just because i want it for myself so i guess i am the only target user ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ .
